# Ex. 01: Let there be voxels..

This example extends ex. 00 with a more useful volume type using NanoVDB to
represent voxels. Course outline: create VDB volume with Blender, export to
OpenVDB, use `nanovdb_convert` to convert it to .nvdb, import in this example.

## TODOs:
- [ ] Implement CPU code path
- [ ] Implement OWL code path
